The Man with will
Chair made of steel
Heart even stronger
Escaped great danger.
Who is this stranger?
His name remember?
Limbs at 50 percent
His spirit heaven sent
God Bless All we pray
And this man this day
But what will happen...
When we all depart
kNOw future's certain
What lays in the dark...
What ever will come
Will add to his sum
of challenges faced
with courage and grace
Life long is his journey
Stopped short was his legs knee
Fate gave us this date to meet
What can I do to make our time complete?
Saving some questions for later...
Remembering we all have to eat
